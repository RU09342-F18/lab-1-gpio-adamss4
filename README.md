# Lab 2: Blink an LED and you can control the world!
In this repository you will find four seperate ways to blink an LED using the MSP430
and MSP432 launchpad dev boards.

## Simple Blink
This blink has one LED blinking via a preset delay using an infinite loop.

## Button Blink
This blink has the LED controlled via a switch on the launchpad, where when pressed, it
toggles on and off.

## Multiple Blink
This blink has two LEDs on the launchpad blinking at different rates via an infinite loop
and conditional statements.

## Off Board Blink
This blink uses the code from the Multiple Blink, but the G2553 is on the breadboard instead
of the launchpad dev board. You will find a .gif of the circuit and blinking LED.
